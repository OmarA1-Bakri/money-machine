# Next Session

**Session 06 is COMPLETE** (2026-10-02, W11 control flip @ `0f94d585`) — Notion integration foundation delivered W1–W10 (#39–#49). All eight evidence keys TRUE. Exit 78 unchanged: worker conditional lift (D-0028 gates), scheduler held. No production Notion or Etsy mutation. Default CLI probe remains `FakeNotionProbe`.

**Session 05 is COMPLETE** (2026-09-24, W11 control flip @ `9b791d45`) — domain agent implementation delivered L1-L4 (Etsy adapters, A03 research, A05 scoring/ProductSpec, A06 dedupe/workflow linking).

## Session 05 completion status (post-W11 @ `9b791d45`)

| Lane | Status | Commit | Evidence key(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L1 — Etsy adapters** | **COMPLETE** | `02211ff` | `etsy_adapters_implemented` = true |
| **L2 — A03 Market Research** | **COMPLETE** | `c64bf58` | `research_agent_implemented`, `shortlist_analysis_implemented` = true |
| **L3 — A05 Product Strategy** | **COMPLETE** | `a7c9521` | `scoring_agent_implemented`, `product_spec_generation_implemented` = true |
| **L4 — A06 Catalogue Dedupe + workflow** | **COMPLETE** | `9b791d45` | `dedupe_agent_implemented`, `teardown_workflow_implemented`, `workflow_linking_complete` = true |
| W11 — control flip to COMPLETE | **COMPLETE** | — | `control_files_and_checkpoint_current`, `evidence_closure_commit_recorded` = true |

**All ten evidence keys TRUE.** Session 05 complete at W11 control flip.

**Exit 78 status UNCHANGED:**
- **Worker:** LIFTED conditionally (D-0028 commissioning gates). Claims READY jobs, executes via AgentRunner, persists results, emits events, creates successors. Uncommissioned agents (DESIGNED) refuse execution.
- **Scheduler:** HELD (W9 out of scope). Cycle (promote due jobs, detect stalled jobs, rebalance) remains fail-closed, deferred to future work.

**Parked L2-L4 nits (non-blocking):** concept_fingerprint drift, evidence SHA self-dump, differentiation self-desc, fail-open suppress, result_id=spec_id. Noted as carry-forward improvement opportunities.

## Session 06 completion status (post-W11 @ `0f94d585`)

| Wave | Status | Evidence key(s) |
|---|---|---|
| W1 — capability matrix, interface, fixture, router | **COMPLETE** | `notion_capability_inspected`, `platform_compatibility_documented`, `notion_adapter_interface_defined`, `fixture_adapter_implemented`, `adapter_router_implemented` |
| W2–W10 — adapters, builders, browser session, fake CLI | **COMPLETE** | `adapter_unit_tests_pass` (1958 passed, 1 skipped at W10) |
| W11 — control flip | **COMPLETE** | `control_files_and_checkpoint_current`, `evidence_closure_commit_recorded` |

Router browser and combined config modes still raise `NotImplementedError` (W4a). Fixture mode stays the default.

## Session 07 — Wave 8 in progress

**Status**: Incomplete (2026-10-06, W8, state revision 56). This is not a session close and it is not SESSION_07 COMPLETE. Twelve evidence keys stay false, including `variant_builder_implemented`. `next_session` stays 7. `next_prompt` stays `10_SESSION_07_PRODUCT_BUILD_VARIANTS_AND_QA.md`. A07, A08, and A09 stay DESIGNED. `commissioned_agents` stays empty. `head_sha` is the W7 squash `9bc56b2c839f66fce13bebf55cb30e88474f526e`. `evidence_closure_commit_sha` stays the Session 06 closure tip. `last_verified_commit` stays bootstrap. Exit 78 scheduler stays HELD.

W8 handoff. Counts and sites are in `IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md` and `TEST_EVIDENCE.md`.

- Fixture-only variants. Two-pass release: refuse every candidate, then drop. The order is validate, release, then the ProductSpec uniqueness bind. Replay does not release.
- Product-build tests: 290 passed. Full local pytest figures are in `TEST_EVIDENCE.md`. The failures are the known local docker failures. CI is the gate.
- Mutation checks: 45 rows, all killed. The Failed column sums to 360. Replacing the validate call with the uniqueness bind failed 27 and includes the 12 leftover tampers. Swapping release and bind inside the try failed 14, and those leftover tampers stayed green.
- State revision is 55 to 56. This wave is not SESSION_07 COMPLETE. Exit 78 stays HELD. Narrative `next_phase` is `qa` (A09) and is not started. It is not a top-level state field. QA, the fact ledger, and the workflow link are not started.
- `test_replay_refuses_a_restored_spec_id_without_a_write` refuses with zero writes. `test_crash_after_write_checkpoint_resumes_without_a_second_page` pins the stored path. `test_crash_inside_write_checkpoint_before_the_file_lands` resumes when the crash happens before the file lands.
- `write_checkpoint` stays the only progress writer. A provider failure still records a repair job when a prior record exists. A refusal does not.
- Provenance is the title plus the copyable shell fields. An unrelated empty workspace page with the source `product_id` and shell block id would be adopted, and `parent_id` compares equal when both are `None`. PARKED for the live wave. Not a proven lineage.
- Docstring coverage stays 10.88% (W6, stale; not remeasured). No live Notion or Etsy mutation. The socket test is a tripwire, not a sandbox.

## Later sessions

**Session 05 delivered scope**:
- L1: Etsy fixture adapter, browser/API stubs, config-driven seed phrases, comprehensive tests
- L2: A03 Market Research agent (fixture-only), ResearchReport with ShortlistAnalysis (top 5 candidates)
- L3: A05 Product Strategy scorer (four-criterion: price/demand/young-fast shops/thin evidence), qualification gate (≥20/40), ProductSpec generation
- L4: A06 Catalogue Dedupe agent (three-rule: exact identity×category, title Jaccard ≥0.7, concept fingerprint), PASS/TOO_CLOSE branching, EventDispatcher workflow linking, fixture teardown

**Remaining domain agent scope** (Session 07+):
- Concept agent (A04): concept definition, differentiation, design specification
- Notion Build agent (A07): workspace setup, database schema, draft pages (successor to DEDUPE_PASSED)
- Variant agent (A08): colour/hub expansion, SKU generation
- Reconcept agent (A08 alt): reconcept loop (successor to DEDUPE_FAILED, L4 out of scope)
- Merchandising agent (A10): description copy, SEO tags, pricing strategy
- QA agent (A11): build artifact validation, preflight checks
- Publisher agent (A12): Etsy draft creation, publication, link verification
- Analytics agent (A14): metrics collection, performance analysis

Later sessions will promote remaining domain agents from DESIGNED to TESTED with:
- Agent-specific prompts (v1)
- Integration tests (real database, fake providers)
- Contract tests (prompt integrity, tool permissions, commissioning refusal)
- Commissioning evidence gates per D-0028
- No live Notion/Etsy mutations until commissioning approval

Those sessions do NOT include:
- Scheduler Exit 78 lift (deferred; promote/stalled-detection/rebalance cycle scope)
- Live production claims
- Commissioning approval to COMMISSIONED state (requires operator decision record)

Session 04 closed 2026-09-20 after W10 control flip (#29, `14da7fe`). Agent runtime delivered, Exit 78 lifted for worker (conditionally, behind D-0028 commissioning gates).

Session 03 closed 2026-09-19 after Verifier FINAL PASS (#17). Gap-close implementation validated: real `dependency_resolver`, scheduler library functions, operator surface (CLI + API), entry-job spawn.

## Carry-forward work

- Prove idempotency uniqueness under a concurrent claim path (only after commissioning).
- Refuse an unreconciled `MetricsSnapshot` as a decision input (Session 02 review, deferred).
- Install Playwright with the first browser-channel work, not before.
- Relate listing description sections and tags as rows rather than checked JSON arrays when merchandising is built (Session 08).
- Vendor capability for every `DIRECT_API` selection, and Etsy field-length limits, remain UNVERIFIED until the owning session reads and cites the vendor reference.
- The CodeRabbit vendor re-review of the Session 00 fixes is still rate-limited; the blocker stays in state.
- **S05 L2-L4 parked nits** (non-blocking, recorded for future lane improvement):
  1. **Concept fingerprint drift**: A05 hashes identity:category (product_strategy.py:278), L4 fixtures hash buyer_problem only (products.py:97) — cross-lane contract inconsistency
  2. **Evidence SHA self-dump**: A05 evidence SHA reuses concept_fingerprint (product_strategy.py:328) instead of independent hash
  3. **Differentiation self-description**: Dedupe differentiation_evidence describes candidate's own fields (dedupe.py:216-225) rather than comparative differentiation from catalogue
  4. **Fail-open suppression**: A06 uses contextlib.suppress(Exception) on invalid spec parsing (catalogue_dedupe.py:115) instead of fail-closed refusal
  5. **Result ID reuse**: Dedupe result_id = spec_id (dedupe.py:231) — could use distinct UUID for audit trail clarity
- **S06 parked nits** (non-blocking, not fixed in the close):
  1. An int-subclass SystemExit code maps to 1
  2. The False SystemExit row needs an isinstance-style mutant
  3. Backtick formatting of `__context__` in the #49 PR body
  4. CodeRabbit APPROVED tip lag on #49
  5. `connected: true` in fake mode (`notion.py` connect payload), still open from review 5328507848
  6. argparse echoing a token passed as an extra argument, still open from review 5328507848

## Environment notes

- The shared development database `money_machine` holds another branch's schema at its own Alembic revision, and the instance carries roughly four hundred leftover test databases from other branches. Nothing on this branch touches them: database-backed tests create and drop their own throwaway databases, and `MONEY_MACHINE_TEST_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL` selects the maintenance connection.
- `pnpm install` needs `--package-import-method copy` on this filesystem: the hardlink rename fails on the 9p `/mnt/d` mount.
- Host port 3000 is occupied by an unrelated development server; set `WEB_PORT` to verify the web container.
