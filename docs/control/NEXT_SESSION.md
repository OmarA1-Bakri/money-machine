# Next Session

**Session 05 is COMPLETE** (2026-09-24, W11 control flip @ `9b791d45`) — domain agent implementation delivered L1-L4 (Etsy adapters, A03 research, A05 scoring/ProductSpec, A06 dedupe/workflow linking). Exit 78 unchanged: worker conditional lift (D-0028 gates), scheduler held.

## Session 05 completion status (post-W11 @ `9b791d45`)

| Lane | Status | Commit | Evidence key(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L1 — Etsy adapters** | **COMPLETE** | `02211ff` | `etsy_adapters_implemented` = true |
| **L2 — A03 Market Research** | **COMPLETE** | `c64bf58` | `research_agent_implemented`, `shortlist_analysis_implemented` = true |
| **L3 — A05 Product Strategy** | **COMPLETE** | `a7c9521` | `scoring_agent_implemented`, `product_spec_generation_implemented` = true |
| **L4 — A06 Catalogue Dedupe + workflow** | **COMPLETE** | `9b791d45` | `dedupe_agent_implemented`, `teardown_workflow_implemented`, `workflow_linking_complete` = true |
| W11 — control flip to COMPLETE | **COMPLETE** | — | `control_files_and_checkpoint_current`, `evidence_closure_commit_recorded` = true |

**All ten evidence keys TRUE.** Session 05 complete at W11 control flip.

**Exit 78 status UNCHANGED:**
- **Worker:** LIFTED conditionally (D-0028 commissioning gates). Claims READY jobs, executes via AgentRunner, persists results, emits events, creates successors. Uncommissioned agents (DESIGNED) refuse execution.
- **Scheduler:** HELD (W9 out of scope). Cycle (promote due jobs, detect stalled jobs, rebalance) remains fail-closed, deferred to future work.

**Parked L2-L4 nits (non-blocking):** concept_fingerprint drift, evidence SHA self-dump, differentiation self-desc, fail-open suppress, result_id=spec_id. Noted as carry-forward improvement opportunities.

## Session 06 — (Future work)

**Status**: Not started. Session 06 prompt: `09_SESSION_06_NOTION_INTEGRATION_FOUNDATION.md`.

**Session 05 delivered scope**:
- L1: Etsy fixture adapter, browser/API stubs, config-driven seed phrases, comprehensive tests
- L2: A03 Market Research agent (fixture-only), ResearchReport with ShortlistAnalysis (top 5 candidates)
- L3: A05 Product Strategy scorer (four-criterion: price/demand/young-fast shops/thin evidence), qualification gate (≥20/40), ProductSpec generation
- L4: A06 Catalogue Dedupe agent (three-rule: exact identity×category, title Jaccard ≥0.7, concept fingerprint), PASS/TOO_CLOSE branching, EventDispatcher workflow linking, fixture teardown

**Remaining domain agent scope** (Session 06+):
- Concept agent (A04): concept definition, differentiation, design specification
- Notion Build agent (A07): workspace setup, database schema, draft pages (successor to DEDUPE_PASSED)
- Variant agent (A08): colour/hub expansion, SKU generation
- Reconcept agent (A08 alt): reconcept loop (successor to DEDUPE_FAILED, L4 out of scope)
- Merchandising agent (A10): description copy, SEO tags, pricing strategy
- QA agent (A11): build artifact validation, preflight checks
- Publisher agent (A12): Etsy draft creation, publication, link verification
- Analytics agent (A14): metrics collection, performance analysis

Session 06+ will promote remaining domain agents from DESIGNED to TESTED with:
- Agent-specific prompts (v1)
- Integration tests (real database, fake providers)
- Contract tests (prompt integrity, tool permissions, commissioning refusal)
- Commissioning evidence gates per D-0028
- No live Notion/Etsy mutations until commissioning approval

Session 06+ does NOT include:
- Scheduler Exit 78 lift (deferred; promote/stalled-detection/rebalance cycle scope)
- Live production claims
- Commissioning approval to COMMISSIONED state (requires operator decision record)

Session 04 closed 2026-09-20 after W10 control flip (#29, `14da7fe`). Agent runtime delivered, Exit 78 lifted for worker (conditionally, behind D-0028 commissioning gates).

Session 03 closed 2026-09-19 after Verifier FINAL PASS (#17). Gap-close implementation validated: real `dependency_resolver`, scheduler library functions, operator surface (CLI + API), entry-job spawn.

## Carry-forward work

- Prove idempotency uniqueness under a concurrent claim path (only after commissioning).
- Refuse an unreconciled `MetricsSnapshot` as a decision input (Session 02 review, deferred).
- Install Playwright with the first browser-channel work, not before.
- Relate listing description sections and tags as rows rather than checked JSON arrays when merchandising is built (Session 08).
- Vendor capability for every `DIRECT_API` selection, and Etsy field-length limits, remain UNVERIFIED until the owning session reads and cites the vendor reference.
- The CodeRabbit vendor re-review of the Session 00 fixes is still rate-limited; the blocker stays in state.
- **S05 L2-L4 parked nits** (non-blocking, recorded for future lane improvement):
  1. **Concept fingerprint drift**: A05 hashes identity:category (product_strategy.py:278), L4 fixtures hash buyer_problem only (products.py:97) — cross-lane contract inconsistency
  2. **Evidence SHA self-dump**: A05 evidence SHA reuses concept_fingerprint (product_strategy.py:328) instead of independent hash
  3. **Differentiation self-description**: Dedupe differentiation_evidence describes candidate's own fields (dedupe.py:216-225) rather than comparative differentiation from catalogue
  4. **Fail-open suppression**: A06 uses contextlib.suppress(Exception) on invalid spec parsing (catalogue_dedupe.py:115) instead of fail-closed refusal
  5. **Result ID reuse**: Dedupe result_id = spec_id (dedupe.py:231) — could use distinct UUID for audit trail clarity

## Environment notes

- The shared development database `money_machine` holds another branch's schema at its own Alembic revision, and the instance carries roughly four hundred leftover test databases from other branches. Nothing on this branch touches them: database-backed tests create and drop their own throwaway databases, and `MONEY_MACHINE_TEST_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL` selects the maintenance connection.
- `pnpm install` needs `--package-import-method copy` on this filesystem: the hardlink rename fails on the 9p `/mnt/d` mount.
- Host port 3000 is occupied by an unrelated development server; set `WEB_PORT` to verify the web container.
