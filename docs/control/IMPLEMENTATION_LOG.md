# Implementation Log

## 2026-08-08T13:43:51Z — Session 00 source/control lane

- Adopted the sole canonical root at `/mnt/d/Money Machine`; the old lowercase root is absent and `wslpath` maps the root to `D:\Money Machine`.
- Rehashed both immutable sources and recorded post-rename byte-identity evidence.
- Deterministically extracted the 21-file canonical prompt pack from COPY markers and verified Appendix hashes/bytes plus calculated source lines and output line counts.
- Added copyright-safe continuous PDF page coverage and exhaustive Chapter 12-16 step, Prompt 1-13, and Workbook Page 1-6 mappings.
- Initialized fail-closed control state as `incomplete`. Runtime, review, Git, and outer verification gates remain pending and must not be inferred from this documentation slice.

## 2026-08-08T14:47:04Z — Session 00 integrated local verification

- Reconfirmed the canonical WSL/Windows root and immutable source hashes; the 21-file prompt pack remains verified.
- Passed the full Python gates: Ruff, strict Pyright, and all 17 Pytest tests.
- Received HTTP 200 from the live API `/health` endpoint and passed Bash and PowerShell parser checks.
- Passed isolated frozen `uv` and `pnpm` installs plus the clean bootstrap and complete web lint, typecheck, test, and build sequence.
- Confirmed Compose resolves `postgres`, `api`, `scheduler`, `web`, and `worker`.
- `timeout 15 docker info` exited 124. Docker-backed PostgreSQL health/runtime is therefore unverified.
- No Git remote exists. Independent reviews, the bootstrap commit, and the distinct evidence-closure commit remain pending; Session 00 stays fail-closed and `next_session` remains `0`.

## 2026-08-08T15:53:49Z — Session 00 review remediation

- Reconciled Compose to one interpolated database credential contract and added authenticated TCP PostgreSQL smoke scripts for Bash and PowerShell.
- Moved completion-transition validation into the shipped `money-machine-control` entry point with atomic persistence and rejection tests against the real CLI.
- Replaced the committed detailed rename receipt with a safe source identity register; detailed receipts remain ignored runtime evidence.
- Added Appendix B line-count validation and a copyright-safe deterministic PDF page-tree/content-stream verifier.
- Reran the full canonical Python gates and a source-only clean bootstrap: Ruff, strict Pyright, 23 Pytest tests, prompt/source verification, frozen installs, web lint/typecheck/2 tests/build, Compose interpolation, and Bash/PowerShell parsing passed.
- Docker daemon responsiveness and authenticated PostgreSQL runtime remain unproven. Fresh post-remediation reviews and Git checkpoints remain pending, so Session 00 remains `incomplete`.
- The latest bounded `docker info` attempt returned exit 1 with `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock`; this supersedes the earlier timeout as the current blocker evidence.

## 2026-08-08T17:26:54Z — Session 00 full-scaffold and second-review repair

- Added every file and directory declared by the canonical repository structure: the deterministic verifier reports 293 files and 96 directories, with inert Python placeholders and fail-closed uncommissioned operational surfaces.
- Repaired completion semantics to require real Git commit objects, exact bootstrap subject, ancestry, branch/HEAD agreement, clean tracked state, and a non-self-referential closure followed by a separate state-pointer commit.
- Isolated Compose contract tests from developer `.env` files and stale ambient `DATABASE_URL` values; static contract checks remain runnable when Docker Desktop is unavailable, while the real CLI check skips with an explicit infrastructure reason.
- Recorded exact Windows, WSL, PowerShell, Git/GitHub CLI, Docker/Compose, Python/uv, Node/pnpm, Chromium, and Playwright availability evidence.
- Integrated canonical gates passed: Ruff across 271 files, strict Pyright with zero findings, 27 Pytest tests with one Docker-CLI skip, scaffold/prompt/PDF verifiers, Bash syntax and fail-closed exits, and PowerShell AST parsing/fail-closed exits.
- A fresh source-only clean copy excluded both private PDF locations and `.omx`; frozen Python/Node installs, the same Python gates, 27 tests with one Docker-CLI skip, clean-clone source verification, web lint/typecheck/2 tests, and a nine-route production build passed.
- Docker Desktop's WSL CLI mount now returns `Input/output error`; Compose CLI, PostgreSQL runtime, and health remain externally blocked. Post-repair review and Git checkpoints remain pending, so Session 00 remains `incomplete`.

## 2026-08-08T17:54:20Z — Session 00 Docker runtime restored

- Docker server `29.4.2` became available. A WSL-only credential-helper PATH mismatch was handled process-locally and then repaired in `scripts/verify_postgres.sh` without changing global Docker configuration.
- Pulled PostgreSQL 16 Alpine, created the Compose network and data volume, reached container `healthy`, and passed an authenticated TCP `psql` query returning exactly `1`.
- Built the API, web, worker, and scheduler images from the repository Dockerfiles. PostgreSQL, API, and web all reached Compose health.
- Container API `/health` returned HTTP 200 with the typed `api` payload; container web `/api/health` returned `dependencies: unverified` and `externalActions: false`.
- Worker and scheduler containers both exited exactly 78 with restart disabled, proving the intended fail-closed uncommissioned boundary.
- Reran the full Python suite with the real Compose CLI: **28 passed** with no skips. A fresh source-only bootstrap also passed its Docker Compose configuration step.
- Runtime gates are now closed. Fresh implementation/adversarial review and the Git checkpoint sequence remain; Session 00 stays `incomplete` until those receipts exist.

## 2026-08-08T20:33:22Z — Session 00 final remediation and implementation approval

- Repaired the bootstrap scripts so both Python and web dependencies are installed from frozen lockfiles; added strict-deny root rules and adversarial ignore probes for tokens, cookies, browser profiles, screenshots, receipts, customer data, and provider payloads.
- Prevented production restart loops by explicitly setting worker and scheduler restart policies to `no`; fresh containers exited intentionally with code 78 and zero restarts.
- Hardened the completion transition so the committed pre-transition state must already contain every non-Git evidence fact, continuity fields cannot be rewritten by the candidate, exactly one outer-gates blocker may be removed, and the closure commit's state must exactly equal the live pre-transition state.
- Fresh canonical and source-only runs passed Ruff across 271 files, strict Pyright with zero findings, **53 Pytest tests**, web lint/typecheck/**2 tests**/nine-route build, Bash and PowerShell parsing/fail-closed checks, development and production Compose resolution, authenticated PostgreSQL, API/web health, and worker/scheduler fail-closed runtime.
- Independent focused re-review changed the implementation verdict from REJECT to **APPROVE** after both HIGH findings were repaired. Adversarial clearance and the three-commit local closure sequence remain pending; the remote blocker remains push-only.
- Independent adversarial re-audit then issued **CLEAR** for the leader-owned local closure sequence after 35 fresh focused tests and a 375-path staging projection with no forbidden paths. This clearance is not itself a completion or push claim; the three required local commits and atomic transition remain.
- Created the exact 375-path bootstrap commit `1abf0d7cca3a6b8cd7efcd0a45523538fd5bfd9d` with subject `chore(bootstrap): initialise money machine autonomous monorepo`. The staged-path manifest matched the adversarial projection, contained no forbidden path or symlink, and immutable source hashes were unchanged immediately before commit.

## 2026-08-08T20:57:00Z — Session 00 atomic completion

- Created evidence-closure commit `50350b9937ad97dabf4be3762a00638d62aaa5b9`, a direct descendant of bootstrap `1abf0d7cca3a6b8cd7efcd0a45523538fd5bfd9d`, containing the exact still-incomplete pre-transition state.
- Ran the shipped `money_machine.control apply-completion` entry point while branch `build/full-automation` was clean and attached at that closure commit. The validator resolved both commit objects, checked the exact bootstrap subject and ancestry, compared the closure document with the live state, and atomically advanced state revision 9 to 10.
- Session 00 is now locally complete: `completed_sessions` is `[0]`, `next_session` is `1`, the canonical Session 01 prompt is selected, all completion evidence is true, and only the precise push-only `REMOTE_NOT_CONFIGURED` blocker remains.
- This completed state and the four companion control documents are checkpointed by the later state-pointer commit containing this entry; the state intentionally does not claim that commit's own object ID.

## 2026-08-08T23:36:23Z — Public GitHub publication and CodeRabbit review

- Acting on explicit operator authorization, created public repository `OmarA1-Bakri/money-machine`, configured `origin`, and pushed `build/full-automation`. Remote HEAD for that branch exactly matched local `ef4a2039d976285d295e429cebbfdd9951bd7bf4`; GitHub reported visibility `PUBLIC` and selected the pushed branch as default.
- The public-visibility instruction supersedes the earlier private-remote assumption for this repository only. The immutable PDF, `.omx`, runtime evidence, secrets, browser state, customer/provider payloads, dependency caches, and local knowledge graph were not tracked or pushed.
- CodeRabbit's all-file CLI attempt was rejected by the 150-file limit, so the review was split into bounded scopes using an isolated empty Git metadata baseline without changing the canonical worktree/index/history.
- CodeRabbit completed agents, domain, integrations, control, and orchestration reviews. It raised four issues: one critical and one major in `control/state.py`, plus trivial locking and logging findings. Persistence, API, tests, apps, and scripts retries were blocked by a 51-52 minute account rate limit because the selected organization lacks an assigned seat/API key.
- No CodeRabbit-suggested change was applied automatically. The issues and incomplete scopes are carried into Session 01 for validation and an authorized fix/re-review cycle.
